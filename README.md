# Goal of the project

Reactive Native app that displays information about open-source GitHub repositories. Each item in the repository list corresponds to a different repository and contains details about that repository, such as its name, description, programming language used, the number of forks (repository copies), the number of people who have starred it (indicating its popularity), the average rating, the number of reviews, and the URL of the repository owner's avatar on GitHub.
